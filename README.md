Field Sustainable Systems with Sensors


Obstacle Avoiding Robot Project  
The bob with blue tape allows the robot's location to be detected by a raised LIDAR sensor, which is transmitted over the wifi network to the robot.  
The robot receives a target's coordinates to path towards and can move around rectangular obstacles in the way.  
The red chassis is a custom design for the robot and 3D printed.  
In collaboration with Mikey W. and Jack J. in Spring 2021, however the pathing algorithm code is solely my creation.  
Networking code provided by Stevens Institute of Technology, libraries by their respective owners.
